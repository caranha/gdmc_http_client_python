# Day 1
- Added a simple ACO to generate the nest.
  - ACO does not expand very much, even with 150*60 ants.
  - It may not have a lot of incentive to explore.
  - It does generate a "cancerous" look, though.
  - It takes around 200 seconds to do this :-/

- Alternatives? Food-Directed BFS?
- Maybe there is a better formulation of ACO that incentivizes
  growth more?
